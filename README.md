# carbonium

> One kilobyte library for easy manipulation of the DOM.

Writing `document.querySelectorAll(selector)` each time you want to do some DOM operations will become tedious.
You can write your own helper function, but that only takes part of the pain away.

## Examples

To clear all elements with class `text`:

```javascript
$(".text").textContent = "";
```

To add the class "important" to all div's with "priority" as content:

```javascript
$("div")
  .filter((el) => el.textContent == "priority")
  .classList.add("important");
```

You can use carbonium to create elements:

```javascript
const error = $("<div class='error'>An error has occured!</div>")[0];
```

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev carbonium
```

Now you can import carbonium:

```javascript
import { $ } from "carbonium";
```

If you don't want to install or use a bundler like webpack or rollup.js, you can import carbonium like this:

```javascript
const { $ } = await import(
  "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/carbonium/dist/bundle.min.js"
);
```

## API

### `$(selector [, document])`

**`selector: string`** - Selector to select elements
**`document: object` (optional)** - Document or element in which to apply the selector

### `$(html [, document])`

**`html: string`** - HTML of element to create
**`document: object` (optional)** - Document or element in which to apply the selector

## Typescript

Carbonium is written in TypeScript and provides all typings.
You can use generics to declare an element type,
for example `HTMLInputElement` to make the `disabled` property available.

```typescript
$<HTMLInputElement>("input, select, button").disabled = true;
```

## Why?

Most websites don't need a JavaScript framework.
JavaScript frameworks often makes sites slower than necessary.

Read for example [this article by Jeremy Wagner](https://css-tricks.com/radeventlistener-a-tale-of-client-side-framework-performance/)
that compares the speed of frameworks with native JavaScript.

Compared to native DOM, carbonium is easier to use.

## jQuery

Isn't this just jQuery and isn't that obsolete and bad practice?

No. Carbonium doesn't have the disadvantages of jQuery:

1. Carbonium is very small: around one kilobyte.
2. There's no new API to learn, carbonium only provides standard DOM API's.

## Name

Carbonium is the Latin name for carbon. Carbon has two forms (allotropes): graphite and diamond.
Just like this library, which presents itself as either a list of elements or the
properties of an element.
